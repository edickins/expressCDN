Git index format
================
== The Git index file has the following format
  All binary numbers are in network byte order. Version 2 is described
  here unless stated otherwise.
   - A 12-byte header consisting of
     4-byte signature:
       The signature is { 'D', 'I', 'R', 'C' } (stands for "dircache")
     4-byte version number:
       The current supported versions are 2, 3 and 4.
     32-bit number of index entries.
   - A number of sorted index entries (see below).
   - Extensions
     Extensions are identified by signature. Optional extensions can
     be ignored if Git does not understand them.
     Git currently supports cached tree and resolve undo extensions.
     4-byte extension signature. If the first byte is 'A'..'Z' the
     extension is optional and can be ignored.
     32-bit size of the extension
     Extension data
   - 160-bit SHA-1 over the content of the index file before this
     checksum.
== Index entry
  Index entries are sorted in ascending order on the name field,
  interpreted as a string of unsigned bytes (i.e. memcmp() order, no
  localization, no special casing of directory separator '/'). Entries
  with the same name are sorted by their stage field.
  32-bit ctime seconds, the last time a file's metadata changed
    this is stat(2) data
  32-bit ctime nanosecond fractions
    this is stat(2) data
  32-bit mtime seconds, the last time a file's data changed
    this is stat(2) data
  32-bit mtime nanosecond fractions
    this is stat(2) data
  32-bit dev
    this is stat(2) data
  32-bit ino
    this is stat(2) data
  32-bit mode, split into (high to low bits)
    4-bit object type
      valid values in binary are 1000 (regular file), 1010 (symbolic link)
      and 1110 (gitlink)
    3-bit unused
    9-bit unix permission. Only 0755 and 0644 are valid for regular files.
    Symbolic links and gitlinks have value 0 in this field.
  32-bit uid
    this is stat(2) data
  32-bit gid
    this is stat(2) data
  32-bit file size
    This is the on-disk size from stat(2), truncated to 32-bit.
  160-bit SHA-1 for the represented object
  A 16-bit 'flags' field split into (high to low bits)
    1-bit assume-valid flag
    1-bit extended flag (must be zero in version 2)
    2-bit stage (during merge)
    12-bit name length if the length is less than 0xFFF; otherwise 0xFFF
    is stored in this field.
  (Version 3 or later) A 16-bit field, only applicable if the
  "extended flag" above is 1, split into (high to low bits).
    1-bit reserved for future
    1-bit skip-worktree flag (used by sparse checkout)
    1-bit intent-to-add flag (used by "git add -N")
    13-bit unused, must be zero
  Entry path name (variable length) relative to top level directory
    (without leading slash). '/' is used as path separator. The special
    path components ".", ".." and ".git" (without quotes) are disallowed.
    Trailing slash is also disallowed.
    The exact encoding is undefined, but the '.' and '/' characters
    are encoded in 7-bit ASCII and the encoding cannot contain a NUL
    byte (iow, this is a UNIX pathname).
  (Version 4) In version 4, the entry path name is prefix-compressed
    relative to the path name for the previous entry (the very first
    entry is encoded as if the path name for the previous entry is an
    empty string).  At the beginning of an entry, an integer N in the
    variable width encoding (the same encoding as the offset is encoded
    for OFS_DELTA pack entries; see pack-format.txt) is stored, followed
    by a NUL-terminated string S.  Removing N bytes from the end of the
    path name for the previous entry, and replacing it with the string S
    yields the path name for this entry.
  1-8 nul bytes as necessary to pad the entry to a multiple of eight bytes
  while keeping the name NUL-terminated.
  (Version 4) In version 4, the padding after the pathname does not
  exist.
  Interpretation of index entries in split index mode is completely
  different. See below for details.
== Extensions
=== Cached tree
  Cached tree extension contains pre-computed hashes for trees that can
  be derived from the index. It helps speed up tree object generation
  from index for a new commit.
  When a path is updated in index, the path must be invalidated and
  removed from tree cache.
  The signature for this extension is { 'T', 'R', 'E', 'E' }.
  A series of entries fill the entire extension; each of which
  consists of:
  - NUL-terminated path component (relative to its parent directory);
  - ASCII decimal number of entries in the index that is covered by the
    tree this entry represents (entry_count);
  - A space (ASCII 32);
  - ASCII decimal number that represents the number of subtrees this
    tree has;
  - A newline (ASCII 10); and
  - 160-bit object name for the object that would result from writing
    this span of index as a tree.
  An entry can be in an invalidated state and is represented by having
  a negative number in the entry_count field. In this case, there is no
  object name and the next entry starts immediately after the newline.
  When writing an invalid entry, -1 should always be used as entry_count.
  The entries are written out in the top-down, depth-first order.  The
  first entry represents the root level of the repository, followed by the
  first subtree---let's call this A---of the root level (with its name
  relative to the root level), followed by the first subtree of A (with
  its name relative to A), ...
=== Resolve undo
  A conflict is represented in the index as a set of higher stage entries.
  When a conflict is resolved (e.g. with "git add path"), these higher
  stage entries will be removed and a stage-0 entry with proper resolution
  is added.
  When these higher stage entries are removed, they are saved in the
  resolve undo extension, so that conflicts can be recreated (e.g. with
  "git checkout -m"), in case users want to redo a conflict resolution
  from scratch.
  The signature for this extension is { 'R', 'E', 'U', 'C' }.
  A series of entries fill the entire extension; each of which
  consists of:
  - NUL-terminated pathname the entry describes (relative to the root of
    the repository, i.e. full pathname);
  - Three NUL-terminated ASCII octal numbers, entry mode of entries in
    stage 1 to 3 (a missing stage is represented by "0" in this field);
    and
  - At most three 160-bit object names of the entry in stages from 1 to 3
    (nothing is written for a missing stage).
=== Split index
  In split index mode, the majority of index entries could be stored
  in a separate file. This extension records the changes to be made on
  top of that to produce the final index.
  The signature for this extension is { 'l', 'i', 'n', 'k' }.
  The extension consists of:
  - 160-bit SHA-1 of the shared index file. The shared index file path
    is $GIT_DIR/sharedindex.<SHA-1>. If all 160 bits are zero, the
    index does not require a shared index file.
  - An ewah-encoded delete bitmap, each bit represents an entry in the
    shared index. If a bit is set, its corresponding entry in the
    shared index will be removed from the final index.  Note, because
    a delete operation changes index entry positions, but we do need
    original positions in replace phase, it's best to just mark
    entries for removal, then do a mass deletion after replacement.
  - An ewah-encoded replace bitmap, each bit represents an entry in
    the shared index. If a bit is set, its corresponding entry in the
    shared index will be replaced with an entry in this index
    file. All replaced entries are stored in sorted order in this
    index. The first "1" bit in the replace bitmap corresponds to the
    first index entry, the second "1" bit to the second entry and so
    on. Replaced entries may have empty path names to save space.
  The remaining index entries after replaced ones will be added to the
  final index. These added entries are also sorted by entry name then
  stage.
== Untracked cache
  Untracked cache saves the untracked file list and necessary data to
  verify the cache. The signature for this extension is { 'U', 'N',
  'T', 'R' }.
  The extension starts with
  - A sequence of NUL-terminated strings, preceded by the size of the
    sequence in variable width encoding. Each string describes the
    environment where the cache can be used.
  - Stat data of $GIT_DIR/info/exclude. See "Index entry" section from
    ctime field until "file size".
  - Stat data of core.excludesfile
  - 32-bit dir_flags (see struct dir_struct)
  - 160-bit SHA-1 of $GIT_DIR/info/exclude. Null SHA-1 means the file
    does not exist.
  - 160-bit SHA-1 of core.excludesfile. Null SHA-1 means the file does
    not exist.
  - NUL-terminated string of per-dir exclude file name. This usually
    is ".gitignore".
  - The number of following directory blocks, variable width
    encoding. If this number is zero, the extension ends here with a
    following NUL.
  - A number of directory blocks in depth-first-search order, each
    consists of
    - The number of untracked entries, variable width encoding.
    - The number of sub-directory blocks, variable width encoding.
    - The directory name terminated by NUL.
    - A number of untrached file/dir names terminated by NUL.
The remaining data of each directory block is grouped by type:
  - An ewah bitmap, the n-th bit marks whether the n-th directory has
    valid untracked cache entries.
  - An ewah bitmap, the n-th bit records "check-only" bit of
    read_directory_recursive() for the n-th directory.
  - An ewah bitmap, the n-th bit indicates whether SHA-1 and stat data
    is valid for the n-th directory and exists in the next data.
  - An array of stat data. The n-th data corresponds with the n-th
    "one" bit in the previous ewah bitmap.
  - An array of SHA-1. The n-th SHA-1 corresponds with the n-th "one" bit
    in the previous ewah bitmap.
  - One NUL.
  ##
## httpd.conf -- Apache HTTP server configuration file
##
# Based upon the NCSA server configuration files originally by Rob McCool.
# This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See  for detailed information about
# the directives.
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.
# After this file is processed, the server will look for and process
# /usr/local/apache_t3.1/conf/srm.conf and then /usr/local/apache_t3.1/conf/access.conf
# unless you have overridden these with ResourceConfig and/or
# AccessConfig directives here.
# The configuration directives are grouped into three basic sections:
#  1. Directives that control the operation of the Apache server process as a
#     whole (the 'global environment').
#  2. Directives that define the parameters of the 'main' or 'default' server,
#     which responds to requests that aren't handled by a virtual host.
#     These directives also provide default values for the settings
#     of all virtual hosts.
#  3. Settings for virtual hosts, which allow Web requests to be sent to
#     different IP addresses or hostnames and have them handled by the
#     same Apache server process.
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so "logs/foo.log"
# with ServerRoot set to "/usr/local/apache" will be interpreted by the
# server as "/usr/local/apache/logs/foo.log".
### Section 1: Global Environment
# The directives in this section affect the overall operation of Apache,
# such as the number of concurrent requests it can handle or where it
# can find its configuration files.
# ServerType is either inetd, or standalone.  Inetd mode is only supported on
# Unix platforms.
ServerType standalone
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
# NOTE!  If you intend to place this on an NFS (or otherwise network)
# mounted filesystem then please read the LockFile documentation
# (available at );
# you will save yourself a lot of trouble.
# Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
ServerRoot "/usr/local/apache_t3.1"
# The LockFile directive sets the path to the lockfile used when Apache
# is compiled with either USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT or
# USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT. This directive should normally be left at
# its default value. The main reason for changing it is if the logs
# directory is NFS mounted, since the lockfile MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL
# DISK. The PID of the main server process is automatically appended to
# the filename.
LockFile /usr/local/apache_t3.1/logs/httpd.lock
# PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
# identification number when it starts.
PidFile /usr/local/apache_t3.1/logs/httpd.pid
# ScoreBoardFile: File used to store internal server process information.
# Not all architectures require this.  But if yours does (you'll know because
# this file will be  created when you run Apache) then you *must* ensure that
# no two invocations of Apache share the same scoreboard file.
ScoreBoardFile /usr/local/apache_t3.1/logs/httpd.scoreboard
# In the standard configuration, the server will process this file,
# srm.conf, and access.conf in that order.  The latter two files are
# now distributed empty, as it is recommended that all directives
# be kept in a single file for simplicity.  The commented-out values
# below are the built-in defaults.  You can have the server ignore
# these files altogether by using "/dev/null" (for Unix) or
# "nul" (for Win32) for the arguments to the directives.
#ResourceConfig conf/srm.conf
#AccessConfig conf/access.conf
# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
Timeout 300
# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.
KeepAlive On
# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100
# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the
# same client on the same connection.
KeepAliveTimeout 15
# Server-pool size regulation.  Rather than making you guess how many
# server processes you need, Apache dynamically adapts to the load it
# sees --- that is, it tries to maintain enough server processes to
# handle the current load, plus a few spare servers to handle transient
# load spikes (e.g., multiple simultaneous requests from a single
# Netscape browser).
# It does this by periodically checking how many servers are waiting
# for a request.  If there are fewer than MinSpareServers, it creates
# a new spare.  If there are more than MaxSpareServers, some of the
# spares die off.  The default values are probably OK for most sites.
MinSpareServers 5
MaxSpareServers 10
# Number of servers to start initially --- should be a reasonable ballpark
# figure.
StartServers 5
# Limit on total number of servers running, i.e., limit on the number
# of clients who can simultaneously connect --- if this limit is ever
# reached, clients will be LOCKED OUT, so it should NOT BE SET TOO LOW.
# It is intended mainly as a brake to keep a runaway server from taking
# the system with it as it spirals down...
MaxClients 150
# MaxRequestsPerChild: the number of requests each child process is
# allowed to process before the child dies.  The child will exit so
# as to avoid problems after prolonged use when Apache (and maybe the
# libraries it uses) leak memory or other resources.  On most systems, this
# isn't really needed, but a few (such as Solaris) do have notable leaks
# in the libraries. For these platforms, set to something like 10000
# or so; a setting of 0 means unlimited.
# NOTE: This value does not include keepalive requests after the initial
#       request per connection. For example, if a child process handles
#       an initial request and 10 subsequent "keptalive" requests, it
#       would only count as 1 request towards this limit.
MaxRequestsPerChild 0
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, in addition to the default. See also the
# directive.
#Listen 3000
#Listen 12.34.56.78:80
# BindAddress: You can support virtual hosts with this option. This directive
# is used to tell the server which IP address to listen to. It can either
# contain "*", an IP address, or a fully qualified Internet domain name.
# See also the  and Listen directives.
#BindAddress *
# Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support
# To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you
# have to place corresponding `LoadModule' lines at this location so the
# directives contained in it are actually available _before_ they are used.
# Please read the file README.DSO in the Apache 1.3 distribution for more
# details about the DSO mechanism and run `httpd -l' for the list of already
# built-in (statically linked and thus always available) modules in your httpd
# binary.

# the order below without expert advice.

### Section 2: 'Main' server configuration
# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'
# server, which responds to any requests that aren't handled by a
#  definition.  These values also provide defaults for
# any  containers you may define later in the file.
# All of these directives may appear inside  containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.
# If your ServerType directive (set earlier in the 'Global Environment'
# section) is set to "inetd", the next few directives don't have any
# effect since their settings are defined by the inetd configuration.
# Skip ahead to the ServerAdmin directive.
# Port: The port to which the standalone server listens. For
# ports < 1023, you will need httpd to be run as root initially.
Port 7180

##  When we also provide SSL we have to listen to the
##  standard HTTP port (see above) and to the HTTPS port
##
Listen 80

# If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run
# httpd as root initially and it will switch.
# User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run httpd as.
#  . On SCO (ODT 3) use "User nouser" and "Group nogroup".
#  . On HPUX you may not be able to use shared memory as nobody, and the
#    suggested workaround is to create a user www and use that user.
#  NOTE that some kernels refuse to setgid(Group) or semctl(IPC_SET)
#  when the value of (unsigned)Group is above 60000;
#  don't use Group nobody on these systems!

# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be
# e-mailed.  This address appears on some server-generated pages, such
# as error documents.

# ServerName allows you to set a host name which is sent back to clients for
# your server if it's different than the one the program would get (i.e., use
# "www" instead of the host's real name).
# Note: You cannot just invent host names and hope they work. The name you
# define here must be a valid DNS name for your host. If you don't understand
# this, ask your network administrator.
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
# You will have to access it by its address (e.g., http://123.45.67.89/)

# DefaultType is the default MIME type the server will use for a document
# if it cannot otherwise determine one, such as from filename extensions.
# If your server contains mostly text or HTML documents, "text/plain" is
# a good value.  If most of your content is binary, such as applications
# or images, you may want to use "application/octet-stream" instead to
# keep browsers from trying to display binary files as though they are
# text.

# The mod_mime_magic module allows the server to use various hints from the
# contents of the file itself to determine its type.  The MIMEMagicFile
# directive tells the module where the hint definitions are located.
# mod_mime_magic is not part of the default server (you have to add
# it yourself with a LoadModule [see the DSO paragraph in the 'Global
# Environment' section], or recompile the server and include mod_mime_magic
# as part of the configuration), so it's enclosed in an  container.
# This means that the MIMEMagicFile directive will only be processed if the

    #AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3
    #AddType application/x-httpd-php3-source .phps
    #
    # And for PHP 4.x, use:

    # If you want to use server side includes, or CGI outside
    # ScriptAliased directories, uncomment the following lines.
    #

    #AddHandler imap-file map
    #
    # To enable type maps, you might want to use
    #
    #AddHandler type-map var
# End of document types.
# Action lets you define media types that will execute a script whenever
# a matching file is called. This eliminates the need for repeated URL
# pathnames for oft-used CGI file processors.
# Format: Action media/type /cgi-script/location
# Format: Action handler-name /cgi-script/location
# MetaDir: specifies the name of the directory in which Apache can find
# meta information files. These files contain additional HTTP headers
# to include when sending the document
#MetaDir .web
# MetaSuffix: specifies the file name suffix for the file containing the
# meta information.
#MetaSuffix .meta
# Customizable error response (Apache style)
#  these come in three flavors
#    1) plain text
#ErrorDocument 500 "The server made a boo boo.
#  n.b.  the (") marks it as text, it does not get output
#    2) local redirects
#ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
#  to redirect to local URL /missing.html
#ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/missing_handler.pl
#  N.B.: You can redirect to a script or a document using server-side-includes.
#    3) external redirects
#ErrorDocument 402 http://some.other_server.com/subscription_info.html
#  N.B.: Many of the environment variables associated with the original
#  request will *not* be available to such a script.
# Customize behaviour based on the browser
    #
    # The following directives modify normal HTTP response behavior.
    # The first directive disables keepalive for Netscape 2.x and browsers that
    # spoof it. There are known problems with these browser implementations.
    # The second directive is for Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0b2
    # which has a broken HTTP/1.1 implementation and does not properly
    # support keepalive when it is used on 301 or 302 (redirect) responses.
    #
    BrowserMatch "Mozilla/2" nokeepalive
    BrowserMatch "MSIE 4\.0b2;" nokeepalive downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
    #
    # The following directive disables HTTP/1.1 responses to browsers which
    # are in violation of the HTTP/1.0 spec by not being able to grok a

# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them.
# Please see the documentation at
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.
# If you want to use name-based virtual hosts you need to define at
# least one IP address (and port number) for them.
#NameVirtualHost 12.34.56.78:80
#NameVirtualHost 12.34.56.78

#     user name is the `one line' version of the client's X.509 certificate.
#     Note that no password is obtained from the user. Every entry in the user
#     file needs this password: `xxj31ZMTZzkVA'.
#   o ExportCertData:
#     This exports two additional environment variables: SSL_CLIENT_CERT and
#     SSL_SERVER_CERT. These contain the PEM-encoded certificates of the
#     server (always existing) and the client (only existing when client
#     authentication is used). This can be used to import the certificates
#     into CGI scripts.
#   o StdEnvVars:
#     This exports the standard SSL/TLS related `SSL_*' environment variables.
#     Per default this exportation is switched off for performance reasons,
#     because the extraction step is an expensive operation and is usually
#     useless for serving static content. So one usually enables the
#     exportation for CGI and SSI requests only.
#   o CompatEnvVars:
#     This exports obsolete environment variables for backward compatibility
#     to Apache-SSL 1.x, mod_ssl 2.0.x, Sioux 1.0 and Stronghold 2.x. Use this
#     to provide compatibility to existing CGI scripts.
#   o StrictRequire:
#     This denies access when "SSLRequireSSL" or "SSLRequire" applied even
#     under a "Satisfy any" situation, i.e. when it applies access is denied
#     and no other module can change it.
#   o OptRenegotiate:
#     This enables optimized SSL connection renegotiation handling when SSL
#     directives are used in per-directory context.
#SSLOptions +FakeBasicAuth +ExportCertData +CompatEnvVars +StrictRequire
    SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
    SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
#   SSL Protocol Adjustments:
#   The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
#   approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait for
#   the close notify alert from client. When you need a different shutdown
#   approach you can use one of the following variables:
#   o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
#     This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
#     SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates
#     the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use
#     this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where
#     mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
#   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
#     This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
#     SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
#     alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
#     practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
#     this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation
#     works correctly.
#   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
#   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
#   keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown
#   Per-Server Logging:
#   The home of a custom SSL log file. Use this when you want a
#   compact non-error SSL logfile on a virtual host basis.

Foreword
In the art of cooking the "Old Southern Mammy" has
few equals and recogonizes no peers.
The following recipes have, with great patience and
kindly perseverance, been drawn from the treasured mem-
ories of Aunt Caroline Pickett, a famous old Virginia cook,
the *'pinch of this" and "just a smacker of that" so wonder-
fully and mysteriously combined by the culinary masters of
the Southland have been carefully and scientifically anaU'^zed
and recorded in this volume, and after a practical test of each
recipe herein presented, the author can, with the fullest de-
griee of confidence, recommend the following as the most at-
tractive and economical combination ever presented.
The variety covers a range sufficient to fully gratify the
demands of the modest as well as the exacting tastes of the
most pronounced epicure, and have been carefully classified
and alphabetically arranged for the convenience of the house-
wife, and a page has been left blank opposite each page of
recipes for her own favorite dishes. It is the author's in-
tention that this little book become a veritable treasure trove
of dainty, appetizing and tasty dishes.
iwi'^l^^i'^llfl
In sweet memories of a happy childhood spent in the
atmosphere of the plantations and cabins of Virginia under
the benign influence of my Dear Old Southern Mammy,
Aunt Caroline, this volume is affectionately dedicated.

cold water.
One cup of hot potatoes mashed fine.
One quart of flour,
One tablespoonful of lard,

Let it rise for about forty-five minutes or longer. Then
when risen, put it into the flour, which has been mixed with
the salt and lard. Do not knead the flour, just stick it to-
gether and beat it for fifteen minutes with rolling pin. If
yeast does not make dough soft enough a little warm water
may be used. After beating the dough, put it into a vessel
to rise in warm place for about three hours. When risen,
roll it lightly until about one-fourth of an inch thick. Then
cut with biscuit cutter and dip into hot grease. Lastly fold
the biscuits over and put into pans to rise about an hour or
more.
Graham rolls are made the same way.

sauce. Mash the whites of the eggs fine and stir them into
the cream sauce. Spread each piece of bread when toasted
with cream sauce, and then grate yolks over the top. Re-
turn to oven and heat just before serving.

HOT CHOCOLATE
One and one-half squares of Baker's Chocolate,
Four teaspoonsful of sugar.
Pinch of salt,

Melt the chocolate over hot water. Add the sugar, salt
and boiling water. When smooth, add the heated milk and
cook twenty minutes in double boiler. Then beat with tgg
beater and flavor. More sugar may be added if desired.
An excellent substitute for whipped cream to serve with
hot chocolate is marshmallows. Drop one in each cup of
the hot liquid.
Tea—SOUTHERN STYLE
Take one-half teaspoonful of tea to one cup of boiling
water. Put the tea in the pot, pour the boiling water upon
it and let stand where it will keep hot for five minutes. Then

water. Pour boiling water over tea leaves and let stand until
milk warm. Then strain and sweeten to taste while tea is
still warm, as it requires less sugar. Serve with crushed ice,
